Students' Calendar
==================

Calendar that uses weekly schedule to generate plan (or 'calendar') for given time span. To allow irregularities, it uses *modifiers* that alter basic schedule on specific dates. Even though it may be used to generate arbitrary schedule, its main purpose is to make calendars for people with repeatable plans - e.g. students.

## Purpose

This project, just like my [previous one](https://github.com/jakubfijalkowski/pluggablebot), was developed during mu "Object-Oriented Programming" course at Warsaw University of Technology. Instead of doing simple exercises, I have chosen to make a bigger project. It has allowed me to implement some of my ideas and check if they have real-world value. I am quite happy with the code and overall result, but I don't plan to develop it further (this approach is flexible, but has quite bad UX)

Because of the requirements, UI and the documentation (both in code and in separate documents) is in Polish. I don't plan to translate it.
